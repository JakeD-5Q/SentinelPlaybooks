# Get-VirusTotalALLReports


Planning on creating a single playbook that will replace the old playbooks. 

- enrich the incident with tags
- edit the sentinel comment to be more useful

- **create automation rules to act on incidents with specific tags**

Meanwhile, the Virustotal directory has the templates and a script to deploy them all at once. Run this in cloud shell.
